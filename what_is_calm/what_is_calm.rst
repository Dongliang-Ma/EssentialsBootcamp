Takeaways
+++++++++

Calms Native Capabilities:

- **Application Lifecycle Management:** Fully automate the provisioning, scaling, and deletion of both traditional multi-tiered applications and modern distributed services using pre-integrated blueprints that make management of applications in private and public clouds extremely simple.
- **Customizable Blueprints:** Simplify the set-up and management of custom enterprise applications by incorporating all elements of each app, including relevant VMs, configurations and related binaries, into an easy-to-use-blueprint that is managed by the infrastructure team. IT teams can eliminate the hours and days currently devoted to routine application management.
- **Nutanix Marketplace:** Blueprints can be published directly to end users through the Nutanix Marketplace, giving application owners and developers the ability to request IT services that can then be instantly provisioned.
- **Governance:** Calm maintains control with role-based governance that limits user operations based on permissions. Additionally, all activities and changes are centrally logged for end-to-end traceability, aiding security teams with key compliance initiatives.
- **Hybrid Cloud Management:** Automate the provisioning of Hybrid Cloud architectures, scaling both multi-tiered and distributed applications across different cloud environments, including AWS. Calm shows the overall utilization and true cost of your public cloud consumption at a glance so that decisions are based on business needs and budget requirements.
