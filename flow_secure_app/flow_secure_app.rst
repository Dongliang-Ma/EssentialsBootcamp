Flow: Secure App
----------------

*The estimated time to complete this lab is 30 minutes.*

Overview
++++++++

Flow is a software-defined networking product tightly integrated into Nutanix AHV and Prism Central. Flow provides rich visualization, automation, and security for VMs running on AHV.
Microsegmentation is a component of Flow that simplifies policy management. Using multiple Prism Central categories (logical groups), you can create a powerful distributed firewall that gives administrators an application-centric policy management tool for securing VM traffic.
Combining this with Calm allows automated deployment of applications that are secured as they are created.

In this exercise you will create a security policy to restrict communication between the application VMs.

Lab Setup
+++++++++

This lab depends on the availability of a multi-tier **Task Manger** web application.

Refer to the :ref:`taskman` lab for instructions on importing and launching the completed **Task Manager** blueprint.

Once you have initiated the **Task Manager** deployment, you can proceed with the lab below. **You do not need to wait for the blueprint deployment to complete to begin this lab.**

Securing An Application
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Flow provides multiple System categories out of the box, such as AppType, AppTier, and Environment, that are used to quickly group virtual machines into security policies.
Start using these categories right away, or add your own categories for custom grouping.

Defining Category Values
........................

Prism Central uses categories as metadata to tag VMs to determine how policies will be applied.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Infrastructure > Categories**.

#. Select the checkbox for **AppType** and click **Actions > Update**.

   .. figure:: images/12.png

#. Click the :fa:`plus-circle` icon beside the last value to add an additional Category value.

#. Specify *Initials*-**TaskMan**  as the value name.

   .. figure:: images/13.png

#. Click **Save**.

#. Select the checkbox for **AppTier** and click **Actions > Update**.

#. Click the :fa:`plus-circle` icon beside the last value to add an additional Category value.

#. Specify *Initials*-**TMWeb**  as the value name. This category will be applied to the application's web tier.

#. Click :fa:`plus-circle` and specify *Initials*-**TMDB**. This category will be applied to the application's MySQL database.

#. Click :fa:`plus-circle` and specify *Initials*-**TMLB**. This category will be applied to the application's HAProxy load balancer.

   .. figure:: images/14.png

#. Click **Save**.

Creating a Security Policy
..........................

Nutanix Flow includes a policy-driven security framework that uses a workload-centric approach instead of a network-centric approach. Therefore, it can scrutinize traffic to and from VMs no matter how their network configurations change and where they reside in the data center. The workload-centric, network-agnostic approach also enables the virtualization team to implement these security policies without having to rely on network security teams.

Security policies are applied to categories (a logical grouping of VMs) and not to the VMs themselves. Therefore, it does not matter how many VMs are started up in a given category. Traffic associated with the VMs in a category is secured without administrative intervention, at any scale.

While you wait for the Task Manager application to be deployed from the Calm blueprint, create the security policies that will protect the application.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Policies > Security Policies**.

#. Click **Create Security Policy > Secure an Application**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Name** - *Initials*-AppTaskMan
   - **Purpose** - Restrict unnecessary access to Task Manager
   - **Secure this app** - AppType: *Initials*-TaskMan
   - Do **NOT** select **Filter the app type by category**.

   .. figure:: images/18.png

#. Click **Next**.

#. If prompted, click **OK, Got it!** on the tutorial diagram of the **Create App Security Policy** wizard.

#. To allow for more granular configuration of the security policy, click **Set rules on App Tiers** rather than applying the same rules to all components of the application.

   .. figure:: images/19.png

#. Click **+ Add Tier**.

#. Select **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** from the drop down.

#. Repeat Steps 7-8 for **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** and **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMDB**.

   .. figure:: images/20.png

   Next you will define the **Inbound** rules, which control which sources you will allow to communicate with your application. You can allow all inbound traffic, or define whitelisted sources. By default, the security policy is set to deny all incoming traffic.

   In this scenario we want to allow inbound TCP traffic on port 80 from all clients on the production network.

#. Under **Inbound**, click **+ Add Source**.

#. Specify the **Environment:Production** and click **Add**.

   .. note::

     Sources can also be specified by IP or subnet, but Categories allow for greater flexibility as this data can follow a VM regardless of changes to its network location.

#. To create an inbound rule, select the **+** icon that appears to the left of **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB**.

   .. figure:: images/21.png

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Protocol** - TCP
   - **Ports** - 80

   .. figure:: images/22.png

   .. note::

     Multiple protocols and ports can be added to a single rule.

#. Click **Save**.

   Calm could also require access to the VMs for workflows including scaling out, scaling in, or upgrades. Calm communicates with these VMs via SSH, using TCP port 22.

#. Under **Inbound**, click **+ Add Source**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Add source by:** - Select **Subnet/IP**
   - Specify *Your Prism Central IP*\ /32

   .. note::

     The **/32** denotes a single IP as opposed to a subnet range.

   .. figure:: images/23.png

#. Click **Add**.

#. Select the **+** icon that appears to the left of **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB**, specify **TCP** port **22** and click **Save**.

#. Repeat Step 18 for **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** and **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMDB** to allow Calm to communicate with the web tier and database VMs.

   .. figure:: images/24.png

   By default, the security policy allows the application to send all outbound traffic to any destination. The only outbound communication required for your application is for the database VM to be able to communicate with your DNS server.

#. Under **Outbound**, select **Whitelist Only** from the drop down menu, and click **+ Add Destination**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Add source by:** - Select **Subnet/IP**
   - Specify *Your Domain Controller IP*\ /32

   .. figure:: images/25.png

#. Click **Add**.

#. Select the **+** icon that appears to the right of **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMDB**, specify **UDP** port **53** and click **Save** to allow DNS traffic.

   .. figure:: images/26.png

   Each tier of the application communicates with other tiers and the policy must allow this traffic. Some tiers such as the load balancer and web do not require communication within the same tier.

#. To define intra-app communication, click **Set Rules within App**.

   .. figure:: images/27.png

#. Click **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** and select **No** to prevent communication between VMs in this tier. There is only a single load balancer VM within the tier.

#. While **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** is still selected, click the :fa:`plus-circle` icon to the right of **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** to create a tier to tier rule.

#. Fill out the following fields to allow communication on TCP port 80 between the load balancer and web tiers:

   - **Protocol** - TCP
   - **Ports** - 80

   .. figure:: images/28.png

#. Click **Save**.

#. Click **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** and select **No** to prevent communication between VMs in this tier. While there are multiple web server VMs, they do not need to communicate with each other.

#. While **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** is still selected, click the :fa:`plus-circle` icon to the right of **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMDB** to create another tier to tier rule.

#. Fill out the following fields to allow communication on TCP port 3306 to allow the database connection between the web servers and the MySQL database:

   - **Protocol** - TCP
   - **Ports** - 3306

   .. figure:: images/29.png

#. Click **Save**.

#. Click **Next** to review the security policy.

#. Click **Save and Monitor** to save the policy.

Assigning Category Values
.........................

.. note::

  By this time, your application blueprint should have finished provisioning. If it has not completed, please wait until it has finished to proceed.

You will now apply the previously created categories to the VMs provisioned from your Task Manager blueprint. Flow categories can be assigned as part of a Calm blueprint, but the purpose of this exercise is to understand category assignment to existing virtual machines in an environment.

#. In **Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Infrastructure > VMs**.

#. Click **Filters** and search for *Initials-* to display your virtual machines.

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. Using the checkboxes, select the 4 VMs associated with the application (HAProxy, MYSQL, WebServer-0, WebServer-1) and select **Actions > Manage Categories**.

   .. figure:: images/16.png

   .. note::

     You can also use the **Label** functionality to make searching for this group of VMs faster in the future.

     .. figure:: images/16b.png

#. Specify **AppType:**\ *Initials*-**TaskMan** in the search bar and click **Save** icon to bulk assign the category to all 4 VMs.

#. Select ONLY the *Initials*\ **-HAProxy** VM, select **Actions > Manage Categories**, specify the **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** category and click **Save**.

   .. figure:: images/17.png

#. Repeat Step 5 to assign **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMWeb** to your web tier VMs.

#. Repeat Step 5 to assign **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMDB** to your MySQL VM.

#. Finally, Step 5 to assign **Environment:Dev** to your Windows client VM.

Monitoring and Applying a Security Policy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before applying the Flow policy, you will ensure the Task Manager application is working as expected.

Testing the Application
.......................

#. From **Prism Central > Virtual Infrastructure > VMs**, note the IP address of your *Initials*\ **-HAPROXY-0...** and *Initials*\ **-MYSQL-0...** VMs.

#. Launch the console for your *Initials*\ **-WinClient-0** VM.

   This VM was provisioned as part of the Task Manager application blueprint.

#. From the *Initials*\ **-WinClient-0** console open a browser and access \http://*HAPROXY-VM-IP*/.

#. Verify that the application loads and that tasks can be added and deleted.

   .. figure:: images/30.png

#. Open **Command Prompt** and run ``ping -t MYSQL-VM-IP`` to verify connectivity between the client and database. Leave the ping running.

#. Open a second **Command Prompt** and run ``ping -t HAPROXY-VM-IP`` to verify connectivity between the client and load balancer. Leave the ping running.

   .. figure:: images/31.png

Using Flow Visualization
........................

#. Return to **Prism Central** and select :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Infrastructure > Policies > Security Policies >**\ *Initials*-**AppTaskMan**.

#. Verify that **Environment: Dev** appears as an inbound source. The source and line appear in yellow to indicate that traffic has been detected from your client VM.

   .. figure:: images/32.png

#. Mouse over the line connecting **Environment: Dev** to **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** to view the protocol and connection information.

#. Click the yellow flow line to view a graph of connection attempts over the past 24 hours.

   .. figure:: images/33.png

   Are there any other detected outbound traffic flows? Hover over these connections and determine what ports are in use.

#. Click **Update** to edit the policy.

   .. figure:: images/34.png

#. Click **Next** and wait for the detected traffic flows to populate.

#. Mouse over the **Environment: Dev** source that connects to **AppTier:**\ *Initials*-**TMLB** and click the :fa:`check` icon that appears.

   .. figure:: images/35.png

#. Click **OK** to complete adding the rule.

   The **Environment: Dev** source should now turn blue, indicating that it is part of the policy. Mouse over the flow line and verify that both ICMP (ping traffic) and TCP port 80 appear.

#. Click **Next > Save and Monitor** to update the policy.

Applying Flow Policies
......................

In order to enforce the policy you have defined, the policy must be applied.

#. Select *Initials*-**AppTaskMan**  and click **Actions > Apply**.

   .. figure:: images/36.png

#. Type **APPLY** in the confirmation dialogue and click **OK** to begin blocking traffic.

#. Return to the *Initials*\ **-WinClient-0** console.

   What happens to the continuous ping traffic from the Windows client to the database server? Is this traffic blocked?

#. Verify that the Windows Client VM can still access the Task Manager application using the web browser and the load balancer IP address.

   Can you still enter new tasks that require communication between the web server and database?

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Microsegmentation offers additional protection against malicious threats that originate from within the data center and spread laterally, from one machine to another.
- Categories created in Prism Central are available inside Calm blueprints.
- Security policies leverage the text based categories in Prism Central.
- Flow can restrict traffic on certain ports and protocols for VMs running on AHV.
- The policy is created in **Save and Monitor** mode, meaning traffic is not actually blocked until the policy is applied. This is helpful to learn the connections and ensure no traffic is blocked unintentionally.
